I implemented the image stitching application in the Image_stitching.py file.

Given a folder with images stored as .jpg or .JPG files, run the code below:
```bash
python Image_stitching.py --folder folderNAME
```

Then the images in the folder will be stitched to a new large picture and stored in the same folder with name same as the folder name.

For example, the default folderNAME is 'glacier4'. So you will create a glacier4.jpg stitched picture.
